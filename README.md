# MODULE-1
# EXP NO:1 C PROGRAM TO FIND THE ASCII VALUE OF A GIVEN CHARACTER
## AIM:
To write a C program to find and display the ASCII value of a given character.
## Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Declare a character variable ch.
3. Get a character input from the user using scanf().
4. Print the ASCII value of the entered character using print().
5. Stop the program.

## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char ch;
    scanf("%c", &ch);
    printf("ASCII value of %c is %d", ch, ch);
}
```
## Output:
